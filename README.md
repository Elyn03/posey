### Project Description

As part of the "Devlab - Project Creative Dev" courses, we had a mission to create a project using ml5.js and for this we created 3 small projects :
- the first one where we have to do 3 "poses"
- the second one where we can see our skeleton
- and the last one we created a face with eyes that follow us when we move our mouse
